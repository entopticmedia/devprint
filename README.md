# devprint

This is a repository with java code to print directly to an OS' default printer so that the ClockworkPi DevTerm's Thermal Printer can be targeted from a java-based application without user dialogue. Processing (https://processing.org/) example with dithering algorithm for image print is included; refer to this file for the necessary PGraphics/PImage and print frame setup.

Also see line 67 in printFunctions.java/.pde to set the amount of copies!

Also see devprint_localsettings.png for system setup.
